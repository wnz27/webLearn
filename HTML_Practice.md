# HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML is the language used to create the websites you visit everyday. It provides a logical way to structure content for websites.
Let's analyze the acronym "HTML," as it contains a lot of useful information. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. Markup languages work by surrounding raw text with information the computer can interpret, "marking it up" to be processed.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements. These elements are often nested inside one another, with each containing information about the type and structure of the information to be displayed in the browser.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as “hyperlinks.” In fact, you probably clicked on many, many hyperlinks on your path to this Codecademy course!
